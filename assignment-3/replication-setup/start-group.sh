#
# This is a script for launching a 3-node group replication cluster of MySQL
# servers running in Docker containers.  When running this script, the following
# environment variable must be set (the script will *not* read environment
# variables from the .env file):
#
#   MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD - This will be the password assigned to the root user
#     for all three nodes in the cluster.
#
# In addition, the following environment variables may be set:
#
#   MYSQL_PORT - If this is set, it will be the host machine port to which to
#     publish port 3306 of the Docker container running the primary MySQL
#     server.  In other words, this will represent the host machine port
#     through which a connection can be made to the primary MySQL server.  If
#     this is not specified, a default value of 3306 is used.
#
#   MYSQL_DATABASE - If this is set, it specifies the name of a new database
#     that will be created within all of three nodes.
#
#   MYSQL_USER and MYSQL_PASSWORD - If both of these are set, a new MySQL user
#     is created on all three nodes with these credentials.  The user is given
#     access to the database with name MYSQL_DATABASE if it is specified.
#
# After the script runs, the following three Docker containers will be started:
#   mysql-s1 - This will be the primary node in the group replication cluster.
#   mysql-s2 - This will be a secondary node.
#   mysql-s3 - This will be a secondary node.
#

#
# Figure out the directory in which this script lives.
#

# that volume can be re-attached to a new MySQL container to "trick" that
# container into skipping the database initialization.  This allows us to load
# MySQL plugins during database setup, which we normally can't do because it
# is disabled for the database initialization step.
