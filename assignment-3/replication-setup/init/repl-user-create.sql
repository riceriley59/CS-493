-- This file contains SQL commands to set up a MySQL user to be used to
-- perform replication between nodes.  These commands are executed on all nodes
-- in the replication group.  See this page from the MySQL docs for more info:
--
-- https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/group-replication-user-credentials.html
--
-- Note that the replication user's password is hard-coded here.  Not the best
-- from a security perspective, but fine for demonstration purposes.
